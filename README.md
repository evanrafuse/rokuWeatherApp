Roku Weather App for Self-Directed

I built this app while learning Roku (BrightScript/SceneGraph). The photographs are from Unsplash. The logo is terrible (that's how you can tell it was made by me). To use this you'll have to get your own API Key for OpenWeather and put it in api_key.json.
pkg:/assets/api_key.json:
{
  "openWeatherKey":"Put_key_here"
}
