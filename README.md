Roku Weather App for Self-Directed

I built this app while learning Roku (BrightScript/SceneGraph). The photographs are from Unsplash. The logo is terrible (that's how you can tell it was made by me).

Changelog:
May 5 - Added Config Files
The app can now be launched with the BrightScript extension, RokuBuilder or RALE.
It will throw an error on launch about TrackerTask. X it and it will launch.
Don't forget to npm install and build install in the root before launching.
Remember to launch with Roku Builder you have to be in the src directory.

April 12 - Added README to git
